# SpatulaCityHomageSite
Code Louisville FEWD Jan 2019 Project - Store site front page for Spatula City from the movie UHF

This website is an homage to Spatula City, one of the commercials in the movie UHF. If you can imagine a store whose only purpose is to sell spatulas "and that's all!"

The webpage is very basic, having eight categories of products with links to (non-existant) pages featuring spatulas that fall under each category.

The site includes these fun features:

A random quote generating function which puts one of 13 spatula related quotes (adjusted from real quotes to be spatula-related) plus one extra coding-related one on the page.

A button that calls a function when clicked that re-runs the quote generating function presenting a new (most of the time) quote.

The background and viewport border color choices are based on the Spatula City billboard and store sign in the movie (see the billboard link in the footer).

In the footer are links to the Amazon, IMDB, and Wikipedia pages for the movie.

There are also links to pages with interesting spatula facts/trivia and UHF trivia.
